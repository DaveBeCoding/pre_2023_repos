I stumbled on PHP and web development, and again it was just programming and more programming. After that I also stumbled on Unity Then I started on a 3-year course on programming.

        <h2>Why the environment</h2>
        <p>
          It matters because the Earth is the only home that humans have and we are destroying it.
          Over the last year, I became very aware of the environment and the current state of it. And I started converting my life to be more eco-friendly, buying eco-friendly products and buying only organic foods.
          So I did that for a year, but then I saw <a href="https://www.cowspiracy.com/">cowspiracy</a> and realized it doesnâ€™t necessarily save the environment, buying organic foods, but going meatless does. The Co2 that comes from the meat industry, is by far the biggest admitter of Co2. So that's why I am a vegan.
